DESCRIPTION:
	 
This simple program is written in Julia. It builds upon the cluster self-energy to compute the superfluid stiffness. The superfluid stiffness can be computed  
by periodizing the cluster Green's function built from the cluster self-energy, by periodizing the cumulant of the cluster Green's function or by tracing
over the cluster Green's function. For all the periodization schemes, both the superfluid stiffness in the pur superconducting state and the mixed
superconducting-antiferromagnetic state can be computed.
	      
The data fed in consists in the cluster self-energy defined over a given Matsubara frequency grid and a column-separated file containing the chemical doping,
the particle density, and the order parameter(s) amplitudes.
The format of the input data and the format of the ouput data are exposed in the pdf file Documentation.pdf in the "doc/LatexDocumentation" folder.
	            
This program uses functions developed in my master's thesis

DEPENDENCIES: 
The script is written to be compatible with Julia v0.6
The libraries used are:
		           
NPZ --> The NPZ package provides support for reading and writing Numpy .npy and .npz files in Julia: https://pkg.julialang.org/detail/NPZ.html
Glob --> Posix-compliant file name pattern matching: https://github.com/vtjnash/Glob.jl
Cuba --> Library for multidimensional numerical integration with four independent algorithms: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and Cuhre: https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl
JSON --> JSON parsing and printing: https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl
Cubature: hcubature --> pure-Julia multidimensional h-adaptive integration: https://github.com/stevengj/HCubature.jl

When the Julia standard libraries have been installed (see INSTALL file in the "src" folder), open a Julia terminal and type in, for example,
> Pkg.add("NPZ")

The packages will be installed in the same folder as SuperStiff.

RUN:
			   
To perform the superfluid stiffness calculations, see the pdf file Documentation.pdf in the "doc/LatexDocumentation" folder and the
examples available in the "examples" folder. A README file is associated to every example.
			     
#########
EXAMPLES:
				        
Examples of computations of the superfluid stiffness are shown in the "examples" directory. Details are given in
the README files of each example folder. Some heavier examples reproduce the results shown in my thesis and the results 
that will be published. The other results, i.e. obtained with other parameters of the Hubbard model, are produced in the exact 
same fashion, only changing the appropriate parameters.
#########

All the program aspects, benchmarks and results in the master's thesis have been tested on a Linux machine, whether it is a remote supercomputer server
or my personal computer. My personal computer ran on Linux Mint 18.1 during the submission process (cat /etc/os-release).
