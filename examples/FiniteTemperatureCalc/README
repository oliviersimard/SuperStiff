Example
############


This example is devised to show an example computing the superfluid stiffness at finite temperature perpendicular to the copper-oxyde plane, with periodizing the Green's function. 
The mixed state case (AF+SC) is shown. The input parameters are the self-energy arrays (vector of matrices) obtained form CTQMC impurity solver. For the program to properly run, 
the folder hierarchy is very important to maintain (see Documentation.pdf).

The input item:

- tp-0.1/ (contains the self-energy arrays for the different dopings for tp=-0.1t and U=8t)

The output items:

- PER_periodized_zz_expected.dat (file containing, from left to right, the chemical potential, the particle density and the superfluid stiffness periodizing the cumulant)

The results are written during runtime. Anyone can kill the program by pressing CTRL+c (Linux), or any corresponding key. It is important to maintain the folder structure
shown in this example. Otherwise, the main program will crash.

For further informations and explainations, see Documentation.pdf in the "doc/LatexDocumentation" folder.
