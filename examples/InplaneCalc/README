############


This example is devised to show an example computing the superfluid stiffness parallel to the copper-oxyde plane, with periodizing the Green's function and the cumulant. 
The mixed state case (AF+SC) is shown. The two important input parameters are the self-energy array (vector of matrices) and the input file containing 
the dSC and AF order parameter amplitudes, the chemical potential and the density of particles. For the program to properly run, the chemical potential, the
density of particles and the order parameter amplitudes have to be laid out in a column-wise separated file.

The input items:

- Loop_COEX.dat (chemical potential, order parameter amplitudes)
- SEvec_b500_SC_AFM/ (contains the self-energy arrays for the different dopings)

The input items must be put in the same folder as the params.json and the main *.jl file.

The output items:

- stiffness_b500_w_2000_coex_int_K_per_U8.dat (file containing, from left to right, the chemical potential, the particle density and the superfluid stiffness periodizing the Green's function)
- stiffness_b500_w_2000_coex_int_K_per_cum_U8.dat (file containing, from left to right, the chemical potential, the particle density and the superfluid stiffness periodizing the cumulant)

In a Julia terminal in which the modules of SuperStiff have been loaded, run

> include("/path/to/file/InplaneSuperStiff.jl")

to load the main program computing c-axis superfluid stiffness.
The results are written during runtime. Anyone can kill the program by pressing CTRL+c (Linux), or any corresponding key.
