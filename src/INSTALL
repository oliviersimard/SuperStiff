INSTALL
############


To install the Julia standard libraries (Base), follow the instructions displayed in the following link: https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html

The easiest and prefered way to install the three modules located in the folder "src" is to open a Julia terminal

$ julia

and type in a command to fetch the module SuperStiff.jl (the example is given when the working directory is "src")

> include("SuperStiff.jl")

The latter command pre-compiles the modules of SuperStiff and loads all the functions setting SuperStiff to be the global scope.
If the file SuperStiff.jl is not located in the "src" file, just specify the full path to that file from the working directory.

##############################
Other installation procedure: 

Another way to install SuperStiff is to move the three modules in "src" in the proper directory using the following command (example for Julia v6.0): 
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.julia/v0.6/SuperStiff && mv PeriodizeSC.jl  Stiffness.jl  SuperStiff.jl $HOME/.julia/v0.6/SuperStiff

Of course, run the above command in the local "src" folder.

To compile, open a terminal and type in:
$ julia

Afterwards, type inside the julia terminal the following line:
> using SuperStiff

This will compile the program. In order for the program to compile, you must install the dependencies listed below.

DEPENDENCIES:
The script is written to be compatible with Julia v0.6
The libraries used are:

NPZ --> The NPZ package provides support for reading and writing Numpy .npy and .npz files in Julia: https://pkg.julialang.org/detail/NPZ.html
Glob --> Posix-compliant file name pattern matching: https://github.com/vtjnash/Glob.jl
Cuba --> Library for multidimensional numerical integration with four independent algorithms: Vegas, Suave, Divonne, and Cuhre: https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl
JSON --> JSON parsing and printing: https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl
Cubature: hcubature --> pure-Julia multidimensional h-adaptive integration: https://github.com/stevengj/HCubature.jl

When the Julia standard libraries have been installed (see INSTALL file in the "src" folder), open a Julia terminal and type in, for example,
> Pkg.add("NPZ")

The packages will be installed in the same folder as SuperStiff.
